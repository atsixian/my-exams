## Why did we build this?
Searching for exams in a PDF is painful. We feel it. While some existing tools allow you to type to search, we wanted to simplify it even more -- Can we do it without search bars? Without typing five course numbers? After hard work, we made this, for you ❤️

## Is it safe?

This tool does not store your credentials. It transmits your credentials in a secure way to the McGill LDAP API, to query your courses. The API only reveals the courses you're enrolled, not your grade or any kind of personal privacy.
